## Task Descriptions

### Task 0: Basic dictionary
- **File:** `0-basic_cache.py`
- **Description:** Create a class `BasicCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and serves as a caching system. It uses a dictionary called `self.cache_data` from the parent class `BaseCaching` and has methods `put` and `get`.

### Task 1: FIFO caching
- **File:** `1-fifo_cache.py`
- **Description:** Create a class `FIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and implements a caching system with a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithm.

### Task 2: LIFO caching
- **File:** `2-lifo_cache.py`
- **Description:** Create a class `LIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and implements a caching system with a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) algorithm.

### Task 3: LRU caching
- **File:** `3-lru_cache.py`
- **Description:** Create a class `LRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and implements a caching system with a Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm.

### Task 4: MRU caching
- **File:** `4-mru_cache.py`
- **Description:** Create a class `MRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and implements a caching system with a Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm.

### Task 5: LFU caching
- **File:** `100-lfu_cache.py`
- **Description:** Create a class `LFUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and implements a caching system with a Least Frequently Used (LFU) algorithm.
